# My-C-projects
I am a beginner learning C++. My current focus is on understanding the basics of programming. I am practicing how to write simple programs that solve small problems, like calculators or number‑guessing games. My goal is to build a strong foundation in C++ syntax and logic so I can later explore more advanced topics like object‑oriented programming, memory management, and algorithms.
